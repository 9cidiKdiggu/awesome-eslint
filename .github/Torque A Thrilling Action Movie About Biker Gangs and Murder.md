## The Plot of Torque
 
The movie begins with Cary Ford (Martin Henderson), a biker who returns to his hometown after six months of hiding in Thailand. He had fled from the country after being framed by Henry James (Matt Schulze), the leader of a rival biker gang called the Reapers, for stealing and hiding some motorcycles that contained crystal meth. Ford reunites with his girlfriend Shane (Monet Mazur), who is also a biker and runs a garage with her friends Dalton (Jay Hernandez) and Val (Will Yun Lee).
 
Ford is soon confronted by Trey Wallace (Ice Cube), the leader of another biker gang called the Hellions, who accuses him of killing his brother Junior (Fredro Starr). Junior was one of the Reapers who was killed by Ford in self-defense when they tried to ambush him in Thailand. Ford denies killing Junior and tries to explain that he was framed by Henry, but Trey does not believe him and vows to kill him. Ford also learns that Henry has put a bounty on his head and hired an FBI agent named McPherson (Adam Scott) to track him down.
 
Ford decides to clear his name by finding the motorcycles that contain the drugs and exposing Henry's involvement. He also tries to avoid Trey and his gang, who are chasing him across the state. Along the way, he encounters various obstacles and enemies, such as a corrupt cop named Henderson (Justina Machado), a rival biker chick named China (Jaime Pressly), and a mysterious assassin named Luther (Faizon Love). He also gets some help from his friends Shane, Dalton, Val, and Nina (Christina Milian), who is Trey's girlfriend and Junior's sister.
 
The movie culminates in a final showdown between Ford and Henry on a moving train, where Ford reveals that he has recorded Henry's confession of framing him and killing Junior. He also reveals that he has planted explosives on the train that will detonate if it stops or slows down. He then jumps off the train with Shane on his motorcycle, while Henry is left to die in the explosion. Ford then gives the recording to McPherson, who clears his name and arrests Henderson for her involvement. Ford also reconciles with Trey, who apologizes for blaming him and respects him for avenging his brother. The movie ends with Ford and Shane riding away on their motorcycle, while Trey and Nina watch them from a distance.
