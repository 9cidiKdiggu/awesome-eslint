I was not let down."<cite><a href="https://everythingrecording.com/review-tone2-nemesis/">Everything Recording</a></cite>

> "Tone2 made sure to take just as much care in designing Nemesis as they did with Rayblaster. Nemesis takes the best aspects of both types of FM synthesis (phase modulation and âreal analog FMâ) and combines them, booting out the negative effects of conventional FM methods."<cite><a href="https://sonicscoop.com/review-nemesis-neofm-synthesis-virtual-instrument-from-tone2/">SonicScoop</a></cite>
